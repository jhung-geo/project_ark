# Project_ARK

### IMPORTANT: Arduino Uno support has been deprecated in this release; compatibility is only guaranteed with the Adafruit Metro M4 Express.

Project ARK's goal is to replace existing Aardvark I2C bridge with Arduino Uno
board (Arduino Replaces aardvarK).  The project contains:

    arduino_io.py       Python interface that allow user to interact with the bridge
    i2c_usb_bridge.ino  Arduino board FW



To use the scripts and firmware code, you need to have:

    Python 2.7 with required modules installed (run "pip install -r requirements.txt")
    Arduino IDE (download here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
    The Arduino modifications available in the arduino_wire repository installed

To build and install the module as a python package, run:

    pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/nextinput_sw/project_ark.git

or, if there's no Internet connection, run:

    python setup.py sdist
    pip install dist/arduino_io-[latest_version].tar.gz


The Arduino board is programmed to act as a virtual serial port to host machine.
User can send and receive data by issuing serial command:

    'A' set the I2C device address
    'a' set the target register address
    'l' set the length of read or write buffer
    'w' indicates it's a write operation
    'r' indicates it's a read operation

For example, to read 3 bytes from device 0x26, register 0x9d:

    "A 26 a 9d l 03 r"

In addition to the main hardware I2C bus (SCL/SDA), an additional two hardware I2C buses are available as:

    Bus     SCL     SDA
    -------------------
    1       A5      A4
    2       SCK     MOSI

To enable these additional hardware I2C buses, you must select the board

    Adafruit Metro M4 NI =^._.^= âˆ« (SAMD51)

You can also control the Arduino digital GPIOs with the following commands:

    'D' sets the pin number (2 through 13)
    'M' sets the pin mode (0 = input, 1 = output, 2 = input pullup)
    '<' reads from the digital pin (0 or 1)
    '>' writes to the digital pin (0 or 1)

Pin config and IO capabilities are accessible through the arduino_io APIs:

    dio_mode
    dio_read
    dio_write
